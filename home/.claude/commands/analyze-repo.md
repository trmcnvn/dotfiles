Please perform a comprehensive analysis of this code repository and create detailed documentation written to REPO_ANALYSIS.MD covering the following aspects:

## 1. Repository Overview
- Provide a high-level summary of the project's purpose and functionality
- Identify the primary programming languages, frameworks, and technologies used
- List key dependencies and external services
- Describe the project's domain and target users

## 2. Project Structure Analysis
- Map out the directory structure and explain the organization pattern
- Identify configuration files and their purposes
- Highlight entry points and main executable files
- Note any build/deployment configurations

## 3. High-Level Architecture Diagram
Create a Mermaid diagram showing:
- Major system components and layers (presentation, business logic, data, etc.)
- External dependencies and integrations
- Data flow between components
- Key architectural patterns used (MVC, microservices, event-driven, etc.)

## 4. Module/Component Analysis
For each major module or component:
- Explain its core responsibility and purpose
- List its public interfaces/APIs
- Identify its dependencies (both internal and external)
- Note any design patterns implemented

## 5. Class/Interface Hierarchy
Create Mermaid class diagrams for core abstractions showing:
- Important classes and interfaces
- Inheritance relationships
- Key associations and dependencies
- Critical methods and properties

## 6. Data Flow and Sequence Diagrams
Create Mermaid sequence diagrams for the most important user flows or system processes:
- User authentication flow
- Main business operations
- Critical system interactions
- Error handling flows

## 7. Module Interaction Map
Create a Mermaid diagram showing:
- How different modules communicate
- API boundaries between modules
- Event flows or message passing
- Shared resources or data stores

## 8. Database/Storage Schema
If applicable, document:
- Database schema or data models
- Key relationships between entities
- Storage patterns and strategies
- Caching mechanisms

## 9. API Documentation
For any exposed APIs:
- List all endpoints with their methods
- Document request/response formats
- Note authentication requirements
- Include example usage

## 10. Key Algorithms and Business Logic
Identify and explain:
- Core algorithms or complex logic
- Business rules implementation
- Performance-critical sections
- Notable design decisions

## 11. Testing Strategy
Document:
- Test structure and organization
- Types of tests present (unit, integration, e2e)
- Test coverage areas
- Testing tools and frameworks used

## 12. Security Considerations
Identify:
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Data validation and sanitization approaches
- Security-related configurations
- Potential security concerns

## 13. Performance and Scalability
Note:
- Performance optimizations implemented
- Caching strategies
- Scalability considerations
- Resource management patterns

## 14. Development Workflow
Document:
- Build and deployment processes
- Development environment setup
- Code style and conventions
- Contribution guidelines

## 15. Technical Debt and Improvement Areas
Identify:
- Areas that could benefit from refactoring
- Outdated dependencies or patterns
- Missing documentation or tests
- Potential architectural improvements

For all diagrams, use Mermaid syntax and ensure they are clear, properly labeled, and include legends where necessary. Provide context and explanations for each diagram to help readers understand the visualizations.

Please organize the output in a clear, hierarchical structure with appropriate markdown formatting. Use code blocks for file examples and ensure all technical terms are explained for readers who may be new to the codebase.
